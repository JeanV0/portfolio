# Introduction

## Timeline

**2020:** I started my studies in hacking, specifically in pentesting. I study a lot about linux, cpu, hardware. exploit, python, programming, assembly (not much), web, networking and general IT and computers.

**2020 - 2021:** I started designing (I lost the main code) recreating metasploit, reverse DNS and many tools for exploration. And at the same time started a project about AD robots (selenium and python). But I'm still stuck because I don't have opportunities to pentest in Brazil.

**2022:** This year, I started to delve deeper into programming. Start studying nodejs, because my friend used to create DDOS botnet, start in a pirated course because I have no money. I do some projects in javascript and my favorite is game system. I will mention in nodejs projects. The system complex with database, microservices, OOP (bad OOP, but I didn't study about it before)

After studying javascript nodejs and realizing that it's not necessary to work in a real job, I need to study typing and... I didn't want to study typing, I wanted something more... And that's how I started to study java, and it was the most months hardest of my life (not irony). After? I stop studying because I got an internship with back end and DevOps

I don't know if I can talk about the things I've done. But, I led the cloud migration as the digital ocean for aws, from s√£o paulo to ohio. I innovated the entire infrastructure (no irony again) in addition to optimizing speed and reducing some current problems. Migrate CDN and many things. Perfomance costs and aplication

**2023:** I went from DevOps and then back end, I solved several instability problems, I worked with service containers and DevOps stuff. In addition to creating ordering system integration from one company to another.

Anyway, in this company that I used php, nginx, docker and nodejs ( typescript ) hard.
